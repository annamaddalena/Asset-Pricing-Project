## Group 1: Testing Fama-French Factors in the Cross-Section of Global Stock Returns

- Perform the test of the CAPM by running a two-steps Fama-MacBeth regression. Interpret the results, comment on the validity of the model and it's ability to explain the cross-section of the portfolio returns.

- Add the additional factor's betas and test the extended model. Interpret the results, comment on the validity of the model and it's ability to explain the cross-section of the portfolio returns. How do the results differ from the previous ones? Provide economic justification of the difference between performances of the model.

- Re-estimate the model out of sample. Compare the performances of the models in both samples. Comment upon the obtained results.
